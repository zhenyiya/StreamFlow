# StreamFlow

Process large-scale data streams and manage distributed services.

### Features

- **High Performance**: Leverages Go's goroutines for maximum concurrency
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time data stream processing with minimal latency
- **Auto-Discovery**: Auto peer discovery
- **Security**: Built-in rate limiting, authentication, and secure communication
- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on workload demands
- **Multi-Protocol**: Support for HTTP, gRPC, and custom protocols

### Architecture

StreamFlow is built on microservices architecture:

- **Master-Worker Pattern**: Efficient task distribution and load balancing
- **Gossip Protocol**: Robust peer-to-peer communication and consensus
- **gRPC Framework**: RPC system for service-to-service communication

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/zhenyiya/streamflow
```

### Create Your First StreamFlow Application

1. **Initialize project:**

```bash
mkdir my-streamflow-app
cd my-streamflow-app
mkdir processors
touch config.json
touch main.go
cd processors
touch data_processor.go

```

1. **Configure your cluster (`config.json`):**
2. **Create your main application (`main.go`):**
3. **Implement your data processor (`processors/data_processor.go`):**

### Launch Application

```bash
go run main.go -mode=streamflow
```

Application should now be running at:

- **API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8080/processors/DataHandler`
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8080`

### Scale Horizontally

1. **Create a second node:**

```bash
cp -r my-streamflow-app my-streamflow-app-node2
cd my-streamflow-app-node2
```

1. **Update the configuration** in `config.json` for the second node:
2. **Launch the second node:**

```bash
go run main.go -mode=streamflow -port=8081
```

Distributed cluster is now active with automatic load balancing!
